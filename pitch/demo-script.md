# 30-Second Demo Script

## Setup
*Demo account pre-loaded with "The Awakening" project*

---

## Script

**[0:00-0:05]** *Open StoryForge with chapter visible*

"This is Elena's story. I've been writing her for three months in StoryForge."

---

**[0:05-0:12]** *Open Canon Vault sidebar, show Elena's character entry*

"The Canon Vault remembers everything—her silver eyes, her fear of magic, her complicated relationship with Marcus."

---

**[0:12-0:18]** *Trigger AI continuation, show conflict detection*

"Watch what happens when the AI writes 'Elena's blue eyes sparkled.' It catches the conflict instantly. My story stays consistent."

---

**[0:18-0:24]** *Switch to Cinema mode, select a scene*

"Now I'm ready to pitch. One click—Cinema Mode. I select the confrontation scene..."

---

**[0:24-0:30]** *Show generated shots and visual prompts*

"...and it generates production-ready shots, visual prompts for every frame. From novel to Netflix, in the same platform."

---

## Key Moments to Highlight

1. **Canon at :12** - The conflict detection is the "wow" moment
2. **Seamless switch at :18** - Mode transition should feel effortless
3. **Production-ready at :24** - Show actual usable output, not sketches

## Backup Talking Points

If time runs long or demo glitches:
- "We have 50,000 tokens free for every writer"
- "Studio tier users have generated 2,000+ shot sequences"
- "Our CLI lets writers work offline and sync later"
