## Canon Integration

### Does Cinema Mode respect my Canon?
Yes! Cinema Mode reads from your StoryForge Canon Vault. When generating shots, it considers:
- Character appearances for visual descriptions
- Location details for settings
- Rules for what's possible in your world
- Themes for mood and tone

### Can I modify Canon from Cinema Mode?
No. Canon is managed exclusively in StoryForge Mode. This ensures your story's truth remains consistent and prevents accidental changes during visualization.

---

## Switching Modes

### Can I switch between StoryForge and Cinema?
Yes, at any time:
1. Open your project settings
2. Click "Switch Mode"
3. Confirm the switch

All content is preserved. You're just changing which tools are visible.

### Will I lose any work when switching?
No. Switching modes is non-destructive. Your writing, Canon, and any generated shots are all preserved.

### Can a project be in both modes?
A project is in one mode at a time, but you can switch freely. Many users write in StoryForge, switch to Cinema for visualization, then switch back to continue writing.
