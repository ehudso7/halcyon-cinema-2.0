# FAQ for Writers

## General Questions

### What is StoryForge?
StoryForge is the writing mode within Halcyon Cinema. It's a complete AI-assisted writing environment for novelists, screenwriters, and series authors. You can write indefinitely in StoryForge without ever touching the Cinema features.

### Do I need Cinema mode to write?
**No.** StoryForge is a fully standalone writing platform. Cinema mode is completely optional and designed for writers who want to visualize their stories for pitching or production. Many users never enable Cinema mode and that's perfectly fine.

### What formats can I write in?
StoryForge supports:
- **Novels** - Traditional prose fiction
- **Manuscripts** - Academic or literary works
- **Screenplays** - Film and TV scripts
- **Series** - Multi-book or episodic content

### How does the AI help me write?
The AI can:
- **Continue** - Pick up where you left off
- **Expand** - Add more detail to selected text
- **Condense** - Tighten prose and remove excess
- **Rewrite** - Offer alternative versions
- **Brainstorm** - Generate ideas for plot, characters, etc.
- **Outline** - Create chapter or story outlines

The AI always respects your Canon Vault and will never silently change established facts about your world.

## Canon Vault

### What is the Canon Vault?
The Canon Vault is your story's source of truth. It stores:
- **Characters** - Names, descriptions, personalities, relationships
- **Locations** - Settings with atmosphere and details
- **Rules** - World-building laws (magic systems, technology, etc.)
- **Events** - Timeline events and their consequences
- **Themes** - Central themes and how they're expressed

### Why is Canon important?
The AI uses your Canon to maintain consistency. If you've established that your protagonist has brown eyes, the AI won't suddenly describe them as blue. Canon prevents plot holes and continuity errors.

### What happens if the AI conflicts with Canon?
The AI will **never silently change Canon**. If it generates content that might conflict, it will:
1. Flag the potential conflict
2. Show you exactly what conflicts
3. Let you choose: keep canon, update canon, or fork timeline

### Can I lock Canon entries?
Yes! Pro users and above can:
- **Soft Lock** - Warn before changes
- **Hard Lock** - Prevent all changes

This is useful for finalized elements of your story.

## Writing & Editing

### How do I start a new chapter?
1. Go to your project's Chapters view
2. Click "Add Chapter"
3. Give it a title and start writing

### Can I rearrange chapters?
Yes, drag and drop chapters to reorder them. The AI will maintain context across any order.

### What's the word count limit?
There's no limit on word count. Write as much as you want. We've had users complete 200,000+ word novels in StoryForge.

### Can I import existing work?
Yes, you can paste existing text or import from:
- Plain text (.txt)
- Markdown (.md)
- Word documents (.docx)

### How does auto-save work?
StoryForge saves automatically every 30 seconds while you're writing. You'll see "Saved" in the status bar. No more lost work!

- Background that shapes how they talk

2. Clear your browser cache
3. Try a different browser
4. Contact support if the issue persists
